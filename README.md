# MEAN-Stack-Auth-log-CRUD


                                                    

This is my first try with MEAN stack. Be indulgent with my code, at some parts he has to be more clear :) 

In this project you have : 
- Add new user in MongoDB with Node JS
- Password encryption
- Validations in MEAN Stack
- CRUD on User model ( like update role, follow or unfollow someone .. )


## API REST

For the APIrest i use : **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**,   

## Testing tool
**POSTMAN**


Here is some example of what my API REST does.
